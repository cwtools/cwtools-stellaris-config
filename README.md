# cwtools-stellaris-config
.cwt config files for Stellaris

To use these copy the contents of the config folder and place it in a folder called `.cwtools` in the folder you open in vscode.
You'll also need to enable the `experimental_completion` setting.

See https://github.com/tboby/cwtools/wiki/.cwt-config-file-guidance for guidance on the file format
